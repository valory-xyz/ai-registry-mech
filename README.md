# AI Registry Mech

## Introduction

This repository contains the Mech Marketplace set of contracts registering mechs and performing their interactions for
requests delivery via the means of the Marketplace. Read [docs](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/docs)
for a detailed Mech Marketplace description.


## Development

### Prerequisites
- This repository follows the standard [`Hardhat`](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/) development process.
- The code is written on Solidity `0.8.28`.
- The standard versions of Node.js along with Yarn are required to proceed further (confirmed to work with Yarn `1.22.19` and npx/npm `10.8.2` and node `v20.18.1`).

### Install the dependencies
The project has submodules to get the dependencies. Make sure you run `git clone --recursive` or init the submodules yourself.
The dependency list is managed by the `package.json` file, and the setup parameters are stored in the `hardhat.config.js` file.
Simply run the following command to install the project:
```
yarn install
```

### Core components
The contracts, deployment scripts and tests are located in the following folders respectively:
```
contracts
scripts
test
```

### Compile the code and run
Compile the code:
```
npx hardhat compile
```
Run the tests:
```
npx hardhat test
```

### Linters
- [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org) is used for JS code.
- [`solhint`](https://github.com/protofire/solhint) is used for Solidity linting.


### Github Workflows
The PR process is managed by github workflows, where the code undergoes
several steps in order to be verified. Those include:
- code installation
- running linters
- running tests


## Deployment and redeployment
The deployment of contracts to the test- and main-net is split into step-by-step series of scripts for more control and checkpoint convenience.
The description of deployment procedure can be found here: [deployment](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/main/scripts/deployment).

The finalized contract ABIs for deployment and their number of optimization passes are located here: [ABIs](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/main/abis).
Each folder there contains contracts compiled with the solidity version before their deployment.

The list of contract addresses for different chains and their full contract configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/main/docs/configuration.json).


### Audits
- The audit is provided as development matures. The latest audit report can be found here: [audits](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-registries/blob/main/audits).
